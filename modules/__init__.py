# The __init__.py file is a special file in Python. It's often empty, but it can also contain Python code. Its main roles are:

# Indicate that a directory is a Python package, so it can be imported the same way a module can be imported.

# Define what should happen when a package is imported. If there's Python code in the __init__.py file, it will be run when the package is imported.

# Define a specific API for the package. You can choose to import specific modules when the package is imported, or define specific attributes.
